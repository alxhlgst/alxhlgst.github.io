		<p class="lead text-justify">
			Junior Year. Not having success with Computer Science, Junior year was a bit of figuring out what to do. What to do involved a lot of science and branching into other fields. 
			This year really exposed be to political and ideological thought, as well as the hard sciences, and I think really helped me understand the world better.
			</br>
			Honors Experiences this year were an Honors section of ART 190, Intro to Drawing, three Quarters of Honors Physics, HONORS 394A: Comparative Ideology: Human Rights Movements,
			and JSIS 202, Cultural Interactions

		<h1>Autumn 2014</h1>

			<h2>ART 190 Intro to Drawing</h2>
			<p>
				This class involved sitting around and improving my drawing abilities, from pencil to charcoal
				There was a certain relaxation in the class, sitting around and drawing for hours.
				Honors reflected an increased workload and pace.
				</br>
				An example of a piece of work: A Portrait of my brother in Charcoal:

			<h2>PHYS 122 H-Mechanics</h2>
			<p>
				Physics is hard. Calculus is hard. Honors Physics at twice the pace of a normal class is even harder. But I learned a lot about the mechanics of the world.
				It is good to have a concrete base of science in ones pocket.

			<h2>HONORS 394A: Comparative Ideology: Human Rights Movements</h2>
			<p>
				
				This class with Clare Bright was an in depth look at many modern issues, and explores the history of civil rights movements across America, 
				with readings from Fredrick Douglass to Dubois to modern Feminism and LGBTQ Writers.
				
				</br>
				This paper explores differences between different types of Feminism
