									Pirates with Clark Speed was a crazy introduction to high level conversation about society. 
									The material was dense, and the conversations in the class have left a lasting impression. 
									</br>
									Three main papers were created for this class. The first was an analysis of Treasure Island, and 
									how Jim Hawkins' ignorance of pirate life was his greatest strength against Long John Silver

								<p>
									The second paper explored the relationship between fetishization of ideas and copyright.
									I wrote it a few years ago at this point, so its best to read it to understand it.

									This final paper builds the idea that Capitalism is a cycle, and much like limestone, there are layers
									of societies and commerace that rise and fall, as economic niches are filled, structure collabses, and the cycle begins anew.
