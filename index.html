				As an undergraduate Human Centered Design and Engineering Major at the University of Washington, 
				I strive to simplify the interactions people face with technology every day. I am a native of Seattle, 
				though I am open to experiencing new locations, having visited Japan twice. One visit occurred shortly 
				after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, in order to experience the recovery efforts. I have been a youth 
				soccer referee for many years, volunteered at cat shelters, and am a serversâ€™ assistant at a local restaurant, 
				but my choice for my career is an interaction designer, with a focus in Human Computer Interaction.
