				<p>
				As undergraduate Human Centered Design and Engineering Major at the University of Washington, 
				I strive to simplify the interactions with technology people face every day. 
				I am a native of Seattle, though I am open to experiencing new locations, having visited Japan twice. 
				One visit occured directly after the 2011 earthquake and Tsunami, in order to experience the recovery efforts.
				I have been a soccer referee for many years, volunteered at cat shelters, and am a server's assistant at a local resturant,
				but my choice for my career is that of an interaction designer, with a focus in Human Computer Interaction.
